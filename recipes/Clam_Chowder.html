    <h2>Description</h2> 
    <p>A wonderful clam chowder to serve with hot sourdough bread, or even better yet, in a sourdough bread bowl. My whole family adores this recipe, I'm sure yours will too! </p>
    <h2>Ingredients 4 servings</h2> 
    <ul>
        <li>1/2 pound bacon, cut into 1/2 inch pieces</li>
        <li>5 unpeeled potatoes, diced</li>
        <li>2 carrots, diced</li>
        <li>salt and papper to taste</li>
        <li>2(6.5 ounce) cans chopped clams with juice</li>
        <li>2(1.8 ounce) packages dry leek soup mix</li>
        <li>1 quart half-and-half</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol type="I">
        <li>Place the bacon in a large pot and cook over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally, until crisped and browned, about 10 minutes. Remove the bacon with a slotted spoon, leaving the drippings in the pot. Set the bacon aside. Stir the potatoes and carrots into the bacon fat. Season with salt and pepper, and cook for 5 minutes, stirring frequently.</li>
        <li>Pour the juice from the clams into the pot, and add enough water to just cover the potatoes. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the potatoes are just tender, 10 to 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Gently stir the leek soup mix into the potatoes until no lumps of soup remain. Stir in the clams, reserved bacon, and half-and-half cream. Cook and stir until the chowder returns to a simmer and thickens, about 10 minutes more.</li>  
    </ol>
